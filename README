1.  Introduction

   This is a PostScript file that generates an Italic calligraphy
   practice sheet.

2.  Why PostScript?

   PostScript is designed to accurately represent printed pages.
   Instead of writing a program that generates an image
   to be embedded in a document, all one has to do is
   copy the PostScript file and change a few parameters inside
   using a text editor.

   PostScript files are easily convertible to PDF files
   using a plethora of tools (Ghostscript, OS X's Preview, etc.).
   Many document editors will automatically convert them.

3.  Use

   Copy template.ps and open it with a text editor.
   Look for a line that looks like this:

      % ---------------------- Configuration -----------------------

   Below it, you'll find various properties defined like this:

      /NibWidthMM     1.0  def

   Change the properties' values ("1.0" in the above example)
   to alter the generated image.  Properties that affect
   letter dimensions are:

      NibWidthMM
         This is the width of the pen nib in millimeters.

      XHeightNibs
         This is the height of a miniscule 'x' letter in pen nibs.

      AscenderHeightNibs
         This is the height of letters' ascenders from the waistline
         (the tops of letters' bodies) in pen nibs.

      DescenderHeightNibs
         This is the height of letters' descenders from the baseline
         in pen nibs.

      CapHeightNibs
         This is the height of majuscule letters lacking descenders
         in pen nibs.

      LetterBoxWidthNibs
         This is the width of each letter box (the space between
         slant lines) in nib widths.

   The following property affects slant lines:

      SlantAngleDegrees
         This is the angle of slant lines from vertical in degrees.
         It must be positive or zero.  (Zero means no slant.)

   Properties that affect the thicknesses of generated lines are:

      AscenderLineWidthMM
         This is the thickness of ascender and descender lines
         in millimeters.

      BaselineWidthMM
         This is the thickness of baselines in millimeters.

      WaistlineWidthMM
         This is the thickness of waistlines in millimeters.

      CapLineWidthMM
         This is the thickness of cap lines in millimeters.

      SlantLineWidthMM
         This is the thickness of slant lines in millimeters.

   To configure the generated page's dimensions and margins,
   edit the lines that look like the following:

      letter SetPaperSize
      10.16 10.16 SetMargins

   SetPaperSize takes two numbers specifying the page's
   width and height in millimeters, respectively.
   For example:

      100 200 SetPaperSize

   produces a page 100mm wide and 200mm tall.
   The template defines aliases for many common paper types,
   such as "letter" and "a4".  The ISO A, B, and C standards,
   JIS B-series, and common North American paper sizes are included:

      a0      b0      c0      jisb0       letter
      a1      b1      c1      jisb1       legal
      a2      b2      c2      jisb2       ledger
      a3      b3      c3      jisb3       tabloid
      a4      b4      c4      jisb4
      a5      b5      c5      jisb5
      a6      b6      c6      jisb6
      a7      b7      c7
      a8      b8      c8

   To use an alias, pass it to the SetPaperSize function like this:

      letter SetPaperSize

   SetMargins takes two numbers representing the horizontal and vertical
   page margins in millimeters, respectively.  For example:

      10.16 20.32 SetMargins

   sets the left and right margins to 10.16mm (0.4 inches)
   and the top and bottom margins to 20.32mm (0.8 inches).

   NOTE: If you convert the PostScript file to a PDF,
         you must tell the converter to generate a PDF
         with the same page size you configured in the PostScript file.
         The SetPageSize and SetMargins functions affect the practice
         area's dimensions, not its page's dimensions.

   If you prefer to use inches, you can add "inches" to any property
   that requires millimeter values.  For example, if you want to set
   the nib width to 1 inch, change NibWidthMM to the following:

      /NibWidthMM     1 inches    def

   You can use "cm" if you prefer centimeters.
